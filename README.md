# MNIST-Dataset
This model was made using just Numpy and knowledge of maths
# Things Learned:
- How we are predicting values based on just maths actually
- Could have stopped the no. of iterations before coz there was not much change in loss
- Visualizing Data is very important
- Things more to learn how can we select a better model, although we will have to then also calc training loss and cross validation loss to figure out the better one.
- Coding only using numpy gave more understanding of how using maths we are creating these
- Basically we initialize W and b and parameters, then find the value then using back prop we find the direction in which if we go then we will get better values, we update the value and run a gradient descent which in each iteration does this thing, to lower the value of loss function.

This is the file for train, test, sample submission files downloaded from the google drive given in the assignment, IT also contains the final submission file for prediction on the test set ( Link: "https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1LcrjLCoCoh_V7tSGTK4fVVFNd3BarvtY")
